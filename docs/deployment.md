# Deployment guide

Step-by-step setup for all six collection lanes. The [README](../README.md) explains *why* the architecture looks like this; this file is the *how*.

Lanes A, B and F need nothing installed. Lanes C, D and E use scheduled collectors; lanes C and E can reuse the same audit app registration. **Skip a collector and every other page still works** — you lose only that lane's data.

---

## Prerequisites

| | Requirement | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | **Power Platform Administrator** (or Global Reader, or AI Administrator) | Lane A — agent inventory |
| Identity | **Reader** on every Azure subscription in scope | Lane A — Azure AI Foundry |
| Identity | A Dataverse security role that can read `systemuser` | Lane B — owner and creator names |
| Identity | **Global Administrator** — to consent to the audit app registration | Lanes C and E |
| Identity | **Power Platform Administrator** — to run the lane D grant | Lane D |
| Identity | **Security Reader** (or any role granting advanced hunting), and Defender for Endpoint with devices onboarded | Lane F — shadow AI |
| Licence | **Power BI Pro** (or PPU / Fabric capacity) and a workspace you can publish to | Publishing |
| Tenant | **Unified audit logging switched on** in Purview | Lanes C and E |
| Tooling | Power BI Desktop (free), Node.js 18+, Azure CLI, .NET 8 SDK (only to rebuild the PBIP) | Building locally |

**Not required:** an Agent 365 licence, Copilot Studio licences, Fabric capacity, Power BI Premium, or an on-premises data gateway.

## Power Platform solutions — install map

There are **two app registrations in total**, not one per solution:

| App registration | Used by | Permission and tenant setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Audit collector app** | `CopilotInteractionLogging` (lane C) and `SharePointAgentLogging` (lane E) | Microsoft Graph application permission `AuditLogsQuery.Read.All`, granted by a Global Administrator; unified audit logging enabled in Purview |
| **Knowledge sweep app** | `AgentAppUserProvisioning` and `AgentKnowledgeSourceSweep` (lane D) | No Graph API permission or admin consent; register it as a Power Platform admin management application. `Agents` scope also needs Reader at the tenant root management group |

Defender does **not** add a third app registration. Lane F uses the signed-in Power BI Organizational-account credential for `https://api.security.microsoft.com`.

Install the solutions in this order:

| Order | Solution or action | App registration | Environment variables | Dataverse connection reference | Finish |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CopilotInteractionLogging_managed.zip` | Audit collector | `poc_Audit_*` plus `poc_KeyVaultSecret` | `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_2dd46` | Turn on both flows; confirm a non-zero run row |
| 2 | `SharePointAgentLogging_managed.zip` | Audit collector — reuse the same tenant, app id and secret | `poc_SP_*` | `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_spagent` | Turn on both flows; run the manual flow once |
| 3 | Provision the four shared lane D tables in [lane D step 2](#2-provision-the-tables) | Knowledge sweep | None yet | None | Confirm the four tables exist |
| 4 | `AgentAppUserProvisioning_managed.zip` | Knowledge sweep | `poc_AU_*` | `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_appusr` | Run first with `poc_AU_WhatIf=true`, then grant and populate the environment manifest |
| 5 | `AgentKnowledgeSourceSweep_managed.zip` | Knowledge sweep | `poc_KS_*` | `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_ksweep` | Turn on the daily flow after the manifest contains environments |

Use the unmanaged ZIP with the same base name only when you intend to edit the flows. For a clean deployment, use the managed ZIPs shown above.

For every imported solution:

1. Select or create the Dataverse connection when the import asks for its connection reference.
2. Enter the environment-variable values when prompted. To change them later, open **Power Apps → Solutions → the imported solution → Environment variables**, edit the **Current value**, and save.
3. Replace every exported tenant, app-id, reviewer and secret value with your own; keep the packaged authority, audience, page-size and polling defaults unless your cloud or scale requires a change.
4. To remap a connection later, open **Power Apps → Solutions → the imported solution → Connection references** and select the Dataverse connection named in the table above.
5. Use either the secret environment variable or its Key Vault counterpart — not both.
6. Turn the imported flows off and on after changing environment-variable values so the new values are bound.
7. Check the run-history table before treating the lane as complete.

---

## Lanes A and B — inventory and identity

Nothing to install. Open `pbip-cloud\AgentInventory.pbip`, set the two parameters, publish, then set credentials in the workspace.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| `InteractionMode` | `Dataverse` for the cloud build, `Csv` to read local extracts |
| `DataverseUrl` | The environment holding the landing tables, e.g. `https://contoso.crm.dynamics.com` |

After publishing, set **all three** data source credentials — Azure Resource Graph, Dataverse and the Defender advanced hunting host — to **Organizational account** with privacy level **Organizational**. If any is left *Private*, the Data Privacy Firewall blocks the model from combining them and the refresh fails with a message that does not mention privacy levels.

---

## Lane C — Copilot interaction telemetry

### 1. Register the app

1. Register an application in Entra ID. No redirect URI is needed.
2. **API permissions** → *Microsoft Graph* → **Application permissions** → `AuditLogsQuery.Read.All`.
3. **Grant admin consent.** Without it every call returns `401` and the flow reports success while writing nothing.
4. Create a **client secret** and record it. Note the expiry.

> `AuditLog.Read.All` is *not* sufficient. `/security/auditLog/queries` is governed by its own `AuditLogsQuery` permission family.

### 2. Import the solution

`solution\CopilotInteractionLogging.zip` (unmanaged) or `solution\CopilotInteractionLogging_managed.zip` (managed — use this for a clean install). It contains:

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `poc_CopilotInteraction` | One row per Copilot turn — the table the model reads |
| `poc_CopilotInteractionFlowRuns` | One row per sync run, with record counts |
| `poc_CopilotInteractionFlowRunErrors` | Per-record failures |
| *Sync Audit Logs to Dataverse* | Daily cloud flow |
| *Manual — Sync Audit Logs to Dataverse* | Same logic, on demand, for verification and recovery |
| Environment variables | Everything in the table below |

> Raw flow exports are **deliberately not committed** — the flow API resolves secret-typed environment variables in plaintext and would embed the live client secret. **A solution export does not mask them either**: if the variable holds a current value, that value leaves the tenant inside the zip. The zips here were exported with the value cleared to the placeholder `insertsecrethere`. Clear the value before you export, and check the export before you share it.

### 3. Set the environment variables

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `poc_Audit_Tenant` | Your tenant GUID |
| `poc_Audit_AppRegID` | The app registration's client ID |
| `poc_Audit_Secret` | The client secret — **or** leave blank and use Key Vault |
| `poc_Audit_UsingAKVtruefalse` | `true` to read the secret from Key Vault instead |
| `poc_KeyVaultSecret` | Key Vault secret reference, when the above is `true` |
| `poc_Audit_Authority` | `https://login.windows.net` |
| `poc_Audit_Audience` | `https://graph.microsoft.com` |
| `poc_Audit_ReviewerEmail` | Who receives failure notifications |
| `poc_AuditMinutestoLookBack` | Window size, e.g. `1440` for one day |
| `poc_AuditEndTimeMinutesAgo` | Lag allowance, so the window ends short of *now* |

The exported values are the source tenant's — **replace them**.

### 4. Turn it on

1. Map `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_2dd46` to a Dataverse connection in the landing environment.
2. Turn the **daily** flow on.
3. For history, run the **Manual** flow once with a much larger `poc_AuditMinutestoLookBack`, then let the daily flow keep it current.

### 5. Verify

Check `poc_CopilotInteractionFlowRuns` for a row with a non-zero `poc_recordsretrieved`. If runs succeed but retrieve nothing, the usual causes are missing admin consent, unified audit logging switched off, or a look-back window that ends before the events were indexed.

**Two things to expect.** The audit log lags by up to ~24h, so the sync is structurally a few days behind — that is the service, not a bug. And a skipped day is not self-healing: the flow syncs a fixed window, so run the manual flow to fill any gap.

---

## Lane D — named knowledge sources

Lane D reads `botcomponents` (`componenttype eq 16`) in **every environment's own Dataverse**, because that is the only place the real SharePoint sites, indexes and connector names exist — Resource Graph carries counts only.

### 1. Register the app

An app registration with a client secret. **No API permissions and no admin consent.** What it needs instead is presence in each environment, which the next step creates.

### 2. Provision the tables

```powershell
node solution\knowledge-sweep\Publish-KnowledgeSources.js --provision --dry-run
node solution\knowledge-sweep\Publish-KnowledgeSources.js --provision
```

This creates everything the sweep flow, the provisioning flow and the manual sweep depend on, and is safe to re-run — anything already present is left alone:

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `poc_agentknowledgesource` | The landing table Power BI reads |
| `poc_sweepenvironment` | The environment manifest — written by step 3, iterated by the daily flow |
| `poc_knowledgesweeprun` | One row per flow run, with counts and status |
| `poc_knowledgesweeperror` | Per-environment and per-record failures |

It also adds the **`poc_uniquekey`** column and the alternate key on it that identifies a knowledge source across runs, backfilling existing rows.

> **Why not `poc_sourceid`?** `botcomponentid` is *not* unique tenant-wide — importing the same solution into many environments preserves its component GUIDs. Measured on a real tenant: 197 ids repeated across 4,251 rows, one of them 13 times. Keying the upsert on it would collapse those rows into one and rewrite it once per environment every night. `poc_uniquekey` is `environmentid_componentid`, which is unique.

> **Why the flow does not address rows *by* that key.** The Dataverse connector's `UpdateRecord` only accepts a primary-key GUID. Passing alternate-key syntax such as `poc_uniquekey='…'` is rejected by the connector gateway with an IIS *File or directory not found* page — verified in testing, where the identical URL called directly against the Web API returns `200`/`204` in every encoding form. So the flow reads a `poc_uniquekey` → GUID index once at the start of the run and updates by real GUID. The alternate key still earns its place: it is what stops a duplicate row ever being created.

These tables are deliberately **not** shipped inside the solution zip. A flow can reference tables outside its own solution, and creating them through the Web API is a path this repo has exercised end to end, whereas hand-authored entity XML cannot be verified short of an import.

### 3. Add the service principal to every environment

This is the part people are most surprised by.

**Dataverse has no tenant-wide service principal.** A service principal can read an environment only where an *application user* record exists in that environment, and being a Power Platform Administrator does not change that — the identity must be provisioned into each environment individually. With 500+ environments that is not a manual job, so it ships as a solution: **`solution\AgentAppUserProvisioning.zip`**.

Import it, then:

1. **Register the app registration as a Power Platform admin management application.** Without this a service principal cannot call `addAppUser` at all — it is not a Dataverse permission and it is not granted by any admin role. A Power Platform Administrator does this once, tenant-wide:

   ```
   PUT https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/adminApplications/{clientId}?api-version=2020-10-01
   ```

   (`New-PowerAppManagementApp -ApplicationId {clientId}` is the same call.)

2. **Set the environment variables.**

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `poc_AU_AppRegID` | The sweep app registration's client id |
   | `poc_AU_Tenant` | Your directory (tenant) id |
   | `poc_AU_Secret` | The app registration's client secret — the same one lane D uses |
   | `poc_AU_UsingAKVtruefalse` | `false`, or `true` to read the secret from Key Vault |
   | `poc_AU_KeyVaultSecret` | The Key Vault secret reference, when the above is `true` |
   | `poc_AU_Authority` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` — change only for a sovereign cloud |
   | `poc_AU_ScopeMode` | `Agents` to grant only where agents live, `Dataverse` to grant wherever Dataverse exists |
   | `poc_AU_WhatIf` | `true` for the first run — reports what it would grant and grants nothing |
   | `poc_AU_MaxGrants` | `25` — caps a real run |
   | `poc_AU_ReassertAll` | `true` re-asserts every environment; set `false` to work through a backlog under the cap |

   `Agents` scope mode additionally needs the app registration to hold **Reader at the tenant root management group** — Azure Resource Graph's `PowerPlatformResources` rows are tenant-scoped and carry an empty `subscriptionId`, so a subscription-level assignment will not work. `Dataverse` scope mode needs no Azure role.

   > **Turn the flow off and on after changing any variable.** Power Automate binds environment-variable values when the flow is enabled, not per run, so an edited value is otherwise ignored.

3. **Map the one connection reference.**

   | Connection reference | Connector | Parameters |
   |---|---|---|
   | `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_appusr` | Microsoft Dataverse | Any connection to this environment |

   There is deliberately no HTTP connection. The flow calls `api.bap.microsoft.com` and `management.azure.com` with Power Automate's native `Http` action using the client secret above, because the *HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID* connector is **blocked from those first-party resources** by Entra preauthorization and fails with `AADSTS65002` no matter what a tenant admin consents to.

4. **Run it with `poc_AU_WhatIf` still `true`** and read the run row in `poc_knowledgesweeprun`: `rowsfound` is the number of environments in scope, `rowsupdated` the number missing a grant. Nothing has been changed at this point.
5. **Set `poc_AU_WhatIf` to `false` and run it for real.** It grants up to `poc_AU_MaxGrants` environments per run and records each one in `poc_sweepenvironment`; re-run until `rowsupdated` reaches zero, raising the cap once you are satisfied. Anything it could not complete lands in `poc_knowledgesweeperror`.

What the flow does:

1. **Lists the environments in scope** — from Azure Resource Graph in `Agents` mode, so the grant follows the agents rather than blanketing the tenant, or every Dataverse environment in `Dataverse` mode.
2. **Resolves each environment's Dataverse URL** from the Power Platform admin API.
3. **Subtracts the environments already in `poc_sweepenvironment`**, leaving only the ones actually missing a grant.
4. **Creates an application user** in each via the BAP admin endpoint, which the service principal may call once it is a registered admin management application:

   ```http
   POST https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/
        scopes/admin/environments/{environmentId}/addAppUser?api-version=2020-10-01
   { "servicePrincipalAppId": "<clientId>" }
   ```

   The call is **idempotent** — re-granting an environment that already has the user succeeds — which is what makes the flow safe to re-run whenever a new environment appears.
5. **Verifies the grant** by signing in to that environment as the service principal and calling `WhoAmI`. `addAppUser` answers `200` optimistically, so this is the only trustworthy signal; anything that cannot be verified is written to `poc_knowledgesweeperror` instead of being recorded as a success.
6. **Writes the manifest** into `poc_sweepenvironment`, which is the list the daily sweep iterates. It reads the manifest rather than calling global discovery because **discovery under-reports badly for an app-only identity** — with 25 application users granted it still returned one environment.

> **Note the privilege, and decide deliberately.** `addAppUser` creates the application user as **System Administrator** — the endpoint offers no lower-privilege option. The collector only ever issues `GET`s, but the grant itself is broad and is applied to hundreds of environments. Mitigations: the flow scopes itself to agent-bearing environments, defaults to what-if, caps a real run, and keeps `poc_sweepenvironment` as your revocation list. Remember that **deleting the app registration revokes access everywhere at once**.

**Why bother:** sweeping as an interactive admin failed in **92 of 525** environments with *"the user has not been assigned any role"* — the admin is present but unprivileged. As an application user, failures went to **0**.

### 4. Import the solution and turn the flow on

Import `solution\AgentKnowledgeSourceSweep.zip` (Power Platform → Solutions → Import), then:

1. **Set the environment variables** — the import prompts for them, or edit them afterwards under the solution.

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `poc_KS_Tenant` | Your tenant GUID |
   | `poc_KS_AppRegID` | The sweep app registration's client id |
   | `poc_KS_Secret` | Its client secret — leave blank if using Key Vault |
   | `poc_KS_UsingAKVtruefalse` | `true` to read the secret from Key Vault instead |
   | `poc_KS_KeyVaultSecret` | Key Vault secret reference, when the above is `true` |
   | `poc_KS_Authority` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` — change for a sovereign cloud |
   | `poc_KS_PageSize` | Dataverse page size, default `5000` |

2. **Fix the connection reference** — map `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_ksweep` to a Dataverse connection in the landing environment. The flow cannot be turned on until this is set.
3. **Turn the flow on.** It imports switched off. Check the run history after the first run, then confirm the counts in `poc_knowledgesweeprun`.

The flow does the same work as the manual sweep below: it reads `botcomponents` where `componenttype eq 16` in each manifest environment (20 environments at a time, 8 rows at a time), upserts into the landing table, and tombstones anything it did not restamp.

### 5. The manual / backfill sweep

The Node path remains the way to bootstrap, backfill after an outage, or run without importing anything:

```powershell
node solution\knowledge-sweep\Collect-KnowledgeSources.js --concurrency 8
node solution\knowledge-sweep\Publish-KnowledgeSources.js --publish
```

`Collect-KnowledgeSources.js` is read-only: it writes a cache under `data\` and nothing to the tenant. `--publish` replaces the landing table's rows from that cache. Add `--dry-run` to rehearse either.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KS_TENANT_ID` | Tenant GUID — set all three to run unattended |
| `KS_CLIENT_ID` | The sweep app registration |
| `KS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Its client secret |
| `KS_DATAVERSE_URL` | Target environment for the landing table |

Without the `KS_*` variables the sweep falls back to your signed-in Azure CLI identity, which is fine for a one-off run but hits the 92-environment gap above.

### 6. Verify

Open the **Knowledge sources** page and check the **Sources collected** card. It reads `2026-09-03 (today)`, `(3d ago)`, `(33d ago - STALE)` past a week, or `Never collected`.

> **Two ways to keep it fresh.** The shipped flow runs daily once you turn it on in step 4; the Node collector below is the manual alternative for a bootstrap or a backfill. If you only ever run the manual path, the published rows are a point-in-time snapshot — the freshness card is what makes that visible.

Agent Builder agents are not covered by this lane at all — they are never stored in Dataverse, so their grounding is visible at *type* level only, from Resource Graph.

---

## Lane E — SharePoint agent inventory

### 1. Reuse or register the audit app

The SharePoint inventory collector uses the same Microsoft Graph application permission as lane C:

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| API permission | `AuditLogsQuery.Read.All` (Application) |
| Consent | Global Administrator consent |
| Extra SharePoint permissions | None — do not add `Sites.Read.All` or `Files.Read.All` |

You can reuse lane C's tenant id, app id and secret. The separate `poc_SP_*` variables and solution keep the flow independently deployable and schedulable.

### 2. Import the solution

Import `solution\SharePointAgentLogging.zip` or `solution\SharePointAgentLogging_managed.zip`. It contains:

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `poc_SharePointAgent` | One row per observed `.agent` file, keyed by `ListItemUniqueId` |
| `poc_SharePointAgentLoggingRun` | Query, inventory and Dataverse write counts per run |
| `poc_SharePointAgentLoggingError` | Query, paging and row-write errors |
| *Daily SharePoint Agent Inventory to Dataverse* | Scheduled full-retention snapshot |
| *Manual — SharePoint Agent Inventory to Dataverse* | Same logic, on demand |

### 3. Set the environment variables

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `poc_SP_Tenant` | Tenant GUID; normally the same as `poc_Audit_Tenant` |
| `poc_SP_AppRegID` | Audit app client id; normally the same as `poc_Audit_AppRegID` |
| `poc_SP_Secret` | Client secret when Key Vault mode is off |
| `poc_SP_UsingAKVtruefalse` | `true` to use `poc_SP_KeyVaultSecret`; otherwise `false` |
| `poc_SP_KeyVaultSecret` | Key Vault-backed secret value when enabled |
| `poc_SP_Authority` | `https://login.microsoftonline.com` for the public cloud |
| `poc_SP_Audience` | `https://graph.microsoft.com` |
| `poc_SP_LookbackDays` | Complete snapshot window; default `180` |
| `poc_SP_PollSeconds` | Delay between asynchronous query checks; default `20` |

Map `poc_sharedcommondataserviceforapps_spagent` to a Dataverse connection in the landing environment, then turn on both flows.

### 4. Run and verify

Run the manual flow once. It starts a Purview `sharePointFileOperation` query filtered by keyword `.agent`, waits for completion, fetches every page, groups by lowercase `ListItemUniqueId`, and writes the latest state of each item. The daily flow then repeats the same complete snapshot.

Check the latest `poc_SharePointAgentLoggingRun` row:

- `poc_status` should be `Completed`
- `poc_recordsretrieved`, `poc_agentrecords` and `poc_agentsfound` should be non-zero
- `poc_currentagents + poc_deletedagents` should equal `poc_agentsfound`
- `poc_rowerrors` should be zero

The acceptance run in the source tenant returned **4,991 records, 723 `.agent` events, 64 distinct items, 61 current and 3 deleted/recycled**, with zero errors.

The table is deliberately an **observed-retention inventory**. A `.agent` file with no file operation inside the lookback window cannot be inferred from the audit log and will not appear.

## Lane F — shadow AI on endpoints

Lane F finds unsanctioned AI desktop tooling — Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Ollama, Cursor — on managed devices. **There is nothing to install and nothing to schedule:** the semantic model queries Defender advanced hunting directly at refresh time, exactly like lanes A and B.

### 1. Check the prerequisites

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Licence | **Defender for Endpoint** (P1/P2 or Defender for Business), with devices onboarded |
| Identity | **Security Reader**, or any Entra role that grants advanced hunting |

Only onboarded devices are visible. Unmanaged and BYO devices are invisible to this lane by definition — worth stating explicitly when presenting the numbers.

### 2. Set the credential

The Defender host is the third data source in the model. In the workspace, set **`https://api.security.microsoft.com`** to **Organizational account** with privacy level **Organizational** — the same as the other two.

**Tick "Skip test connection" before signing in.** Power BI validates a Web source by issuing a plain `GET` against the registered host, and the advanced hunting API serves no document at its root, so the test always comes back:

> Failed to update data source credentials: Web.Contents failed to get contents from `'https://api.security.microsoft.com/'` (404): Not Found

That 404 is the API behaving normally, not a bad credential — the host is registered bare precisely because the query travels in `RelativePath` and `Query`, which is what keeps the source *static* and refreshable without a gateway. Skipping the test stores the token and refresh then calls `api/advancedqueries` correctly. The other two sources do not need this.

### 3. Verify

Open the **Shadow AI** page. Three layers are queried separately, because they answer different questions:

| Layer | Table | Proves | Blind to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Installed** | `DeviceTvmSoftwareInventory` | a packaged AI app is present | portable binaries, per-user installs |
| **Executed** | `DeviceProcessEvents` (30 days) | the tool actually ran, and by which user | tools installed but not launched in the window |
| **Network** | `DeviceNetworkEvents` (30 days) | the device reached an AI service | nothing — the broadest layer, and the only one that sees pure browser use |

A tool that appears in *Network* but not in *Installed* is the normal shape for browser-based use, not an inconsistency. The **Executed** layer is the one that catches CLI tooling such as Claude Code and GitHub Copilot CLI, which never appears in software inventory because it installs per user without an installer.

---

## Credential lifecycle

| Secret | Used by | Watch for |
|---|---|---|
| Lanes C and E audit app registration | The Copilot interaction and SharePoint inventory flows | Both collectors stop advancing; each records its own failed run |
| Lane D app registration | `Collect-KnowledgeSources.js`, the *Provision Sweep App Users* flow | Fails **silently** — `poc_collectedat` simply stops advancing |

**An expiring secret is the most likely way this report goes stale.** Set a calendar reminder against the audit and knowledge-sweep app expiry dates. Lane D is the dangerous one, which is exactly why the freshness card exists.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| Agent counts far lower than expected | The signed-in identity lacks a tenant-wide role. ARG returns only what you can see, silently. |
| Foundry projects missing | Missing **Reader** on those subscriptions. Absent subscriptions do not error. |
| Refresh fails mentioning data combination | A credential is set to *Private*. All three must be **Organizational**. |
| Interaction pages empty, refresh green | Lane C not installed, or the flow ran but retrieved nothing. Check `poc_CopilotInteractionFlowRuns`. |
| Knowledge sources page empty, refresh green | Lane D has never run. `FnDataverseOptional` degrades a missing table to an empty one by design. |
| SharePoint agents page empty, refresh green | Lane E has never completed or no `.agent` operation exists inside the lookback window. Check `poc_SharePointAgentLoggingRun` and `poc_SharePointAgentLoggingError`. |
| Sweep returns 403 for many environments | Running interactively rather than as the application user, or those environments have no grant yet. Run the *Provision Sweep App Users* flow first. |
