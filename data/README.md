# `data\` — local CSV folder for the `pbip\` build

This folder is where the **`pbip\` (CSV) build** looks for its rows. It is **not committed**: a real
tenant extract runs to roughly 150 MB, and `FactCopilotInteraction.csv` contains user-level
interaction rows that should not live in a repo.

The **`pbip-cloud\` build does not read this folder at all** — it queries Azure Resource Graph,
Dataverse and Defender advanced hunting directly.

## Where the files come from

`sample-data\agent365-sample-data.zip` ships a complete, anonymised copy of every file below.
Unzip it and point the `pbip\` build's `DataFolder` parameter at the unzipped `data` folder — that
is the normal way to open the CSV build, and it needs no tenant access at all.

To report on your own tenant, use `pbip-cloud\AgentInventory.pbip`, which reads the same sources live.
