Agent Builder carries a titleId on exactly the 100 agents that are published, because the identifier is minted at publish - the 71 unpublished drafts therefore have no join key to the audit log, which is correct rather than a broken join. One caveat: paging this export with $skipToken is only stable when the query orders by a UNIQUE column. Ordering by titleId, which is empty on most rows, returned the right total but a wrong split of 20,512/158; ordering by id returned the correct 20,499/171."

Enumerating the rest needs an Azure AI data-plane role on every project, which a tenant-wide inventory identity is unlikely to hold.
